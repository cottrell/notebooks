Additionally, NI employer contributions are absolutely ridiculous. Additionally, 'For every £2 your adjusted income goes over £150,000, your annual allowance for that year drops by £1. The drop is limited so that the minimum tapered annual allowance you can have is £10,000.' But this only applies if threshold income is less than 110. Need three things for this calc a) net income b) threshold income and c) adjusted income. The real calculation shoudl involve what effectively tax rate is given you max out your pension contrib. So at 210k you have only 10k contribution room.",

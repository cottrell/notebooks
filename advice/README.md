# Recommendations for people getting into AI/ML/Applied Math/Data Science/Quant Finance

## Logging, notetaking etc

Use git for text, git-lfs for notebooks. git will still be around in 20 years.

Use latex for notes with math. It will still be around in 20 years.

Use Zotero to keep track of articles and books. Set up the plugin in your browser. You can use in latex on drag and drop citations to text/markdown files. You can tell Zotero to keep a local bibtex file in sync.

Create a latex document for notes. Add a table of contents. Append dated subsection entries (like a journal) to the top to keep track of your ideas, what you did etc. Do this nearly every day.

Perhaps use vscode for latex, code etc. It works well for compiling latex on the fly.

Keep a text log file with fast entry script (see _did_post.sh for example) for simple events.

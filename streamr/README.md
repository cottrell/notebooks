See https://github.com/streamr-dev/cli-tools

    npm install -g @streamr/cli-tools

You get a private key from metamask which is available as a chrome extension at the moment.

How do you authenticate in the command line?
See [here](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-javascript/) for js version.

Subscription works:

    streamr subscribe 7wa7APtlTq6EC5iTCBy6dw

Looks like you probably need to use the node.js version directly for authentication.

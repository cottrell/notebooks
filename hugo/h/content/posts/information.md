What information is worth getting and how can we extract value from it?

Consider some examples. Suppose you are mostly honest and honest person and you recently experience a sharp increase in confidence in your knowledge about something. For example

* farm payroll numbers
* inflation numbers
* who will win the next election
* whether a stock will be much more bought than sold

You might have spent some resources to accrue this knowledge and you think you know it with more certainty than the larger group (the public, or whatever). How can you extract real value from it somehow? If you can act on it without explicitly sharing the knowledge, that is relatively easy.

A few things matter a lot. Primarily whether you can take gain value from the information without sharing (selling) it.

* communcation cost: what is the cost for people to even understand the information.
* trust: will people believe it more than you (you are a scammer but they don't know and you don't know it) or less than you (they think you are a scammer)?
* value: how does the value of having the knowledge change the more it is successfully shared? Maybe it is useless unless *everybody* believes than everybody believes it.  This is often more complicated and more uncertain than you think at large scales.

When information is shared, the value can increase or decrease. The order of knowledge of course matters in many cases (who knows what first), but a simple view can be useful.
Mostly, knowledge travels from local to common. A good example is farm payroll. This is common data, but the aggregate is not known until
